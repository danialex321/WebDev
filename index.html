      About myself
      </h2>
      <p>
        I am a self-taught person who learns fast with a creative and innovative profile. I know how to work in a team and under pressure. I've had jobs in customer service, software development, data analysis, and content creation. I have given several programming and robotics courses workshops to children and adolescents. Also, I was a mentor of the FIRST FRC robotics team at my high school.
